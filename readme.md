<h4>Mooring Lines Properties</h4>

Scripts calculate properties of mooring chains, wires and ropes, given nominal diameter of link for chain or nominal diameter of the rope.</p>

"moorchain.py" - calculates properties of mooring chain, Studless and Studlink.<p>
"moorwire.py" - calculates properties of:</p>
- Nylon rope</p>
- Polyester rope</p>
- Polypropylene rope</p>
- Wire rope with fibre core</p>
- Wire rope with wire core</p>

Results are written in "txt" - file in working directory. </p>
In order to run scripts, one will need to add to "python-path" function file "inout.py", which may be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ddjokic/Python-Bin).</p>
**Note:** Although full attention had been given to accuracy of the scripts, and they never failed on me, use results as preliminary and wherever it is possible use original maker's data.</p>
