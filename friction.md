<h4>Friction coefficient for Anchor Chain</h4>
Coeficient of friction depends on type of Ocean Bottom at the actual Anchor Location. It had been noticed that for the same type of botton, different friction forces had been on play during deployment of mooring and usage, later on. Those differencies are captured as "Starting" (no sliding) and "Sliding" friction coefficients.</p>

Ocean Bottom | Starting frict. | Sliding frict.
:----------- | :-----------: | -----------:
Sand         | 0.98        | 0.74
Mud with sand         | 0.92        | 0.69
Firm mud|1.01|0.62
Soft mud|0.90|0.56|
Clay|1.25|0.81|
